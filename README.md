# LinkTune
LinkTune stores a large database of users. Each user is able to pick a song from a large dataset and share it with their friends. The personalized playlist for each user consists of all the user’s friends’ recommended songs. Users can add friends by entering their username in our specialized search tab. The profile tab displays the user’s history of recommended songs, list of friends, and a profile photo that can be changed.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Swift, Firebase, Xcode, UIKit
This software is developed using the Xcode IDE and the Swift programming language. Data is stored in Firestore and updated via event listeners. The user interface is designed with Storyboard, which connects user interactions to the underlying code. Our icons and overall design are crafted using Adobe Illustrator, providing a minimalist style inspired by modern trends.

During the development process, we gained a wide range of skills, including app design, development, and working with the Swift programming language. We also learned how to implement databases like Firebase and navigate Xcode effectively. Additionally, we recognized the immense value of teamwork, as our collaboration was key to successfully bringing our project to finish. We all came in with different technical skillsets, and worked together to learn from and teach one another.
